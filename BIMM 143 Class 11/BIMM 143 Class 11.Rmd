# Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv",row.names=1)
head(db)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
method.sums <- colSums(db)
method.sums
method.sums/method.sums["Total"]
```

X-Ray = 87.6%, EM = 4.92%

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
column.sums <- rowSums(db[ ,c(1:5)])
column.sums
```

```{r}
column.sums/method.sums["Total"]*100
```

87% of PDB structures are protein only, 97% of the structures contain some protein.

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 83790 structures that result when I search for HIV-1 protease structures.

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We just see the oxygen atom in the water molecule because the size of a hydrogen atom is smaller than the smallest representation VMD can provide.

> Q5: There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have (see note below)?

The water molecule is on residue 308.

# Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
# load the library
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
aa123(pdbseq(pdb))
```
```{r}
# ATOM records
head(pdb$atom)
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?
 
 HOH
 
 > Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?
